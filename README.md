## Project Introduction

I am learning Web Development. This respository contains all projects I do for learning Web Development.

## Start

I started by doing the [HTML](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/HTML_Challenges), [CSS](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/CSS_challenges) and [Javascript](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/JavaScript_Challenges) Challenges to know the basic of HTML, CSS and Javscript.

Note: I found some of the study articles they linked in the challenges are out of date, but the challenges are still pretty good to help us learn knowledge from projects. So I suggest when you stuck in the tasks, you'd better search online to learn the latest technology. The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a good resouce.

## Contributing guidelines

- You can study with me from Start part -- doing the HTML, CSS and Javascript challenges.

- Welcome to open issues to discuss study problems you meet.
