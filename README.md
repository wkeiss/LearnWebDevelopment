## Project Introduction

I am learning Web Development. This respository contains all projects I do for learning Web Development.

## Start

I started by doing the [HTML](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/HTML_Challenges), [CSS](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/CSS_challenges) and [Javascript](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/JavaScript_Challenges) Challenges to know the basic of HTML, CSS and Javscript.

**Note:** 

- I found some of the study articles they linked in the challenges are out of date, but the challenges are still pretty good to help us learn knowledge from projects. So I suggest when you stuck in the tasks, you'd better search online to learn the latest technology. The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a good resouce.

- The [JavaScript Challenge 9:_An_intro_to_YUI_-_A_Calendar_Control](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/JavaScript_Challenges#Challenge_9:_An_intro_to_YUI_-_A_Calendar_Control) is out of date, the YUI libary is not active now. so you can skip this one. And you can the date picker in this challenge refer to through html input type ' date' . For details, you can check [`<input type="date">` - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)

- As [JavaScript Challenge 7: Unobtrusive_Javascript](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/JavaScript_Challenges#Challenge_7:_Unobtrusive_Javascript) said, recalling javascript function in HTML element attributes is not a good practice. We should make the Javascript code separated from the HTML code, like the CSS code. But since the the JavaScript Challgens's solutions are simple and small, for convenience, I still use HTML attributes to call the event.


## Contributing guidelines
