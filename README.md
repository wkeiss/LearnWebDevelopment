## Project Introduction

I am learning Web Development. This respository contains all projects I do for learning Web Development.

## Start

I started by doing the [HTML](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/HTML_Challenges), [CSS](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/CSS_challenges) and [Javascript](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/JavaScript_Challenges) Challenges to know the basic of HTML, CSS and Javscript.

**Note:** 

- I found some of the study articles they linked in the challenges are out of date, but the challenges are still pretty good to help us learn knowledge from projects. So I suggest when you stuck in the tasks, you'd better search online to learn the latest technology. The [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is a good resouce.
- The [JavaScript Challenge 9:_An_intro_to_YUI_-_A_Calendar_Control](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/JavaScript_Challenges#Challenge_9:_An_intro_to_YUI_-_A_Calendar_Control) is out of date, the YUI libary is not active now. so you can skip this one. And you can the date picker in this challenge refer to through html input type ' date' . For details, you can check [`<input type="date">` - HTML: HyperText Markup Language | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/date)
- As [JavaScript Challenge 7: Unobtrusive_Javascript](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/JavaScript_Challenges#Challenge_7:_Unobtrusive_Javascript) said, recalling javascript function in HTML element attributes is not a good practice. We should make the Javascript code separated from the HTML code, like the CSS code. But since the the JavaScript Challgens's solutions are simple and small, for convenience, I still use HTML attributes to call the event.

## Continue >> Gain Basic Knowledges

Basic knowledges are those can help you learn more and go further. 

After finished the the [HTML](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/HTML_Challenges), [CSS](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/CSS_challenges) and [Javascript](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Web_Design/JavaScript_Challenges) Challenges,  I have the basic understanding of what HTML, CSS and Javascript can do in Web Development, but I found myself was lack of basic knowledge of CSS layout and Javascript, so I learnt CSS layout  and Javascript at [MDN Learn Webdevelopment Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn). 

For CSS layout,  the Tutorial give enough details to let you understand the CSS properties, like position, display. For Javascript, I knew I need to more familiar with the grammar, I was going to use FreeCodeCamp to learn Javascript, but I finally gave up, since it divides the knowledge to very small isolated pionts, I don't know why do I need to learn them, which made me lost interests soon. But MDN Javscript Turial is under the Web Development Context, it will give you the examples on Web Development to explain the knowledge, it more fun and easier to learn. So I strongly recommend the  [MDN Learn Webdevelopment Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)! My MDN learning codes are all in [the file named mdn](/mdn).

Sometimes you maybe will be confused some concepts,  even after you have read the MDN posts.  You can search the new terms and see different people how to explain them,  which will be helpful for your understanding. Many times when I felt confused, the [W3Schools Online Web Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/) make me clear, since it explains the concepts using few short simple sentences.

## Next >> Projects

It's neccessary to build at least one website when you learning web development. I wrote a single page all by my hands except the design. I used [this open source design](https://themewagon.com/themes/timer-free-responsive-multi-page-personal-bootstrap-template/). You can see my codes of my first site `timer` in [the file named timer](/timer). And I also wrote [a note to record this first exprience of building a website](https://www.cindyli.top/What-I-learned-from-Building-My-First-Website/).

After finished the CSS layout and Javascript Tutorial, I was interested in wrote a web applicaiton can post small thoughts. So I learnt django and build a project `lonely Island`. The Lonely Island project is in [this respository](https://github.com/wkeiss/lonelyisland).
